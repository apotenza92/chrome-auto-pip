# Chrome Automatic Picture-in-Picture (PiP)

Free and open source.

Automatically enables Picture-in-Picture when switching tabs like Arc or Firefox or Zen.

Also works with Brave Browser (and I assume other Chromium based browsers, though I have not tested those).

Includes one click activation of Picture-in-Picture through plugin icon.
